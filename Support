## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do daily finds work?
Every day at 11 AM (your local time), you receive a new personalized find challenge. You have 24 hours to complete it by taking a photo of the item or location.

### How do I maintain my streak?
Complete your daily find before the 24-hour timer expires. Your streak increases by 1 for each consecutive day you complete a find.

### What if my find is impossible?
Use the Appeal system in the app. Our team reviews appeals within 24 hours and may:
- Extend your timer
- Provide additional hints
- Replace the find with a new one

### How do hints work?
Hints automatically unlock 3 hours before your find expires. They provide helpful clues without making it too easy.

### Can I restore a broken streak?
Yes! If you break your streak, you can restore it within 24 hours using the Streak Restore in-app purchase ($0.99).

### How do I change my privacy settings?
Go to Settings → Privacy to control:
- Who can see your finds (Public/Friends/Private)
- Who can message you
- Notification preferences

### How do I delete my account?
